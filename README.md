United States - Map of Tweets.

Collected on Wed. January 27, 2021.

Using crawler script I was able to collect tweeter data from all over the United States by using a keyword "election." Based on the data collected and the map produced from the data, the Eastern part of the U.S. has had more tweeter users tweeting about something relatted to "election." However, the Western part of the U.S. specifically those who life in and near California has frequently tweeted using the keyword "election" in their tweets. I also noticed that there were not as many tweets related to "election" from Washington.
